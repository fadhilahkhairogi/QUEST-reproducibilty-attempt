NBA career statistics Regular season Playoffs The Trent Tucker Rule On January 15, 1990, when Tucker was with New York, with 0.1 of a second remaining in a game against the Chicago Bulls, he got off a wild three-point shot before the buzzer and made the basket. The shot counted and the Knicks won
Candidate Sentence: The shot counted and the Knicks won. After Bulls' coach Phil Jackson vociferously complained following the game, the NBA immediately established a rule, which states that 0.3 needs to be on the clock in order for a player to get a shot off whether they make it or not. Inside of 0.3 seconds, only a tip-in or a high lob would count.
This rule is also used in 3x3 basketball.
Post-playing career After retiring, Tucker worked as a broadcast analyst for Minnesota Timberwolves basketball games
