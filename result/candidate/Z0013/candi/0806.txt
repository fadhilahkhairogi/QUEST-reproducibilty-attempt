Candidate Sentence: But it's name is really growing across the country and employers are definitely impressed by it.  A lot of the time Wake is thought of as a business/pre-med only school but the liberal arts flourish on campus and we have some of the greatest professors out there.  Wake could definitely use some more social spaces on campus.  Winston-Salem isn't as bad as it may seem
