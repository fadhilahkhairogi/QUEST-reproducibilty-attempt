Candidate Sentence: And you can always talk about New Orleans (people love asking whether or not there is a city "down there" anymore) to keep the conversation going.    There are going to be issues on any campus, and the case is no different from Tulane.  Sometimes the wireless internet doesn't work.  Sometimes the financial aid system has a glitch and I can't sign up for my classes when I'm supposed to.  But most of the services on campus are willing to help out, and are understanding of their own shortcomings
Candidate Sentence: But most of the services on campus are willing to help out, and are understanding of their own shortcomings.  And if there is a real problem at Tulane, the students' voices are actually heard.

Candidate Sentence: The students are fighting for the administration to ban it. The website is basically a portal for gossiping and bullying. It is absolutely horrible what people write about others. It needs to be taken off of the internet. Unfortunately, this radical of an action probably won't happen until someone commits suicide, because of the horrible things people are writing about them. Honestly, the website needs to go.    There is a ridiculous amount of school pride here. Everyone here loves it

Candidate Sentence: It has plenty of great comfortable furniture to hang out or study in.    Besides the Greek life issue, Tulane's administration does a great job listening to the students. We wanted a fall break; they gave it to us. They have great emergency plans, and we get biweekly emails from the president himself.    I would say the biggest controversy on campus lately is a website called JuicyCampus. The students are fighting for the administration to ban it.

Candidate Sentence: Low turnout tends to make events a little less cool.    When I tell people I go to Tulane, they are almost always really impressed.  Because, if you know your schools, you know that Tulane is a very good school with a lot of great professors and a very prestigious history, as well as a remarkable present life.
