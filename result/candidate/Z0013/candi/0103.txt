Candidate Sentence: The school is a good size with a good reputation.  If you tell a peer that you go to Georgetown, he or she may just nod and ignore, but if you tell someone beyond college (e.g. future employer?) you go to Georgetown, then a compliment will most likely ensue.    There is a great amount of school pride, especially during basketball season.

Candidate Sentence: Off-campus housing is expensive.  MSB grads have the 2nd highest starting salaries of b-school undergrads.
Best thing about Georgetown is its positioning as a college campus with access to DC.  That being said, one thing I would change is to increase our access to DC even more with more bus routes to downtown or by having a metro stop closer to campus, but that will likely never happen given the stance of Georgetown residents.    The school is a good size with a good reputation
