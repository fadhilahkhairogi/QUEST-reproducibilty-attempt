Candidate Sentence: There isn't much school pride, most likely because we don't have a football team and because we don't know what our mascot actually is. Campus is very pretty though and everything is quite new here so those amentities are very nice. You have to make your own fun and DC is only 25 minutes away. There are a lot of good restaurants in the area. Also all parties are off campus because of strict security on campus with drinking.

Candidate Sentence: My freshman year, I thought school pride was a myth.  During our Final Four run, it was amazing how much different the campus dynamic felt.  The campus never quite  fully returned to its apathetic state, and the atmosphere again became electric when we were the CAA champions this year as well.
