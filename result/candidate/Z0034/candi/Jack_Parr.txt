Jack Parr (March 13, 1936 – January 4, 2015) was an American professional basketball player.  Parr was born in Louisville, Kentucky.  He played college basketball at Kansas State University.  Kansas State retired his jersey, and his number 33 is hanging from the rafters.  He was drafted by the Cincinnati Royals in the 10th round of the 1958 NBA draft
Candidate Sentence: Rugged and strong, he would sweep the boards. Parr's assortment of shots included a hook and a soft "face the basket" jumper. Against Kansas in Lawrence in 1958, Parr made perhaps his greatest defensive play. With the final seconds ticking away, Kansas went to Wilt Chamberlain under the basket for an assumed easy lay-in. Parr went straight up and batted the ball away, enabling K-State to take a thrilling 79–75 victory.
