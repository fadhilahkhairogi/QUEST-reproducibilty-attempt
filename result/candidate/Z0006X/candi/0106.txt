Candidate Sentence: There is a controversy that takes over campus for about a week a year.  We have a "free speech" area on campus, where any student or person can proclaim or share any information they wish.  For a few days a year, a group of people from the community come to this area and preach that "Homosex is Sin."  This gets most people on campus very agitated and excited for about one week every year.      Most Georgia Tech students do not graduate in four years.  That is just a fact
Candidate Sentence: I wish every student at Georgia Tech loved, more importantly, KNEW every Tech tradition.  Sometimes I think it's amazing that our athletic department is as strong as it is, based on the small percentage of fan base.

Candidate Sentence: You really couldn't ask for a better location!  There is always something to do in Atlanta and it is a great place to live and work after you graduate!      There is a ton of school pride!  I feel like one of the qualifications for getting accepted is knowing the Ramblin' Wreck song, or at least "I'm a Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech and a helluva engineer"!      One experience I will always remember was meeting Red Jesus!  Unfortunately he graduated this semester but is an icon on Tech's campus! Copyright © 2011 U.S
