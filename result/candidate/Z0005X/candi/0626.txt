Candidate Sentence: Low turnout tends to make events a little less cool.    When I tell people I go to Tulane, they are almost always really impressed.  Because, if you know your schools, you know that Tulane is a very good school with a lot of great professors and a very prestigious history, as well as a remarkable present life.  And you can always talk about New Orleans (people love asking whether or not there is a city "down there" anymore) to keep the conversation going
