Wake Forest's ranking in the 2011 edition of Best Colleges is National Universities, 25. Its tuition and fees are $39,970.
Wake's size is just right
Candidate Sentence: But it's name is really growing across the country and employers are definitely impressed by it.  A lot of the time Wake is thought of as a business/pre-med only school but the liberal arts flourish on campus and we have some of the greatest professors out there.  Wake could definitely use some more social spaces on campus.  Winston-Salem isn't as bad as it may seem

Candidate Sentence: I was abroad in the fall and I couldn't wait to get back.  Wake really becomes a home.  As much it may seem like a bubble sometimes (and it is), it's a really great place that I can't wait to get back to when I'm gone.
Best thing: Small southern school  Wake: mixed reactions: "That's a wonderful school" to "I'm sorry, where?"    If you don't have a car or know someone who does, it's almost impossible to get off campus.    Absolutely terrible, unorganized, financial department
