Harvey Mudd will give you a wonderful education
Candidate Sentence: I spend most of my time underground... all the engineering labs are underground, its annoying. It's a nice, small college town. The town of claremont is really nice, even though there are a lot of old people. I don't like the administration, I don't get the feeling they care about the students, they care about the image of the school more. The profs are great though. There is a lot of school pride, but more dorm pride. Everyone feels they belong to a specific dorm

Harvey Mudd will give you a wonderful education.  The courses are very interesting, but also very intense.  While most schools require 4 classes per semester to graduate, Mudd requires 5 and a lab.  All of my professors know my name and it is very easy for me to meet with them and discuss homework problems
Candidate Sentence: And that happens quite often. School is a little small sometimes... everyone knows everything about everyone and that can get annoying. People are always impressed when I tell them I go to Mudd and they have heard about the school. I recently interviewed for an internship (which I got) and the person I interviewed with was in awe of Mudd and said the smartest man he ever knew went to Mudd. I spend most of my time underground... all the engineering labs are underground, its annoying
