Candidate Sentence: You really do experience a connection between the person you want to be and the person people recognize in you, as recognition has a way of coming easily.  That's a great feeling, and that's the advantage of a small school, and perhaps this one specifically, though again, I have very little comparative basis.

Candidate Sentence: We are steadily losing that quality, and within ten years we will have sold our soul to be exactly like every other goddamn "new Ivy" out there.

Candidate Sentence: I feel like the student body and the climate are the main difference between any given small liberal arts college. Coming to Mac I might have had some preconceived notions about what kind of kids I would encounter, but I mostly expected it to be more cool people and less stupid idiots (than high school). For the most part that's true, because you don't get in unless you have some kind of brain, and that generally entails some kind of social skills
