Candidate Sentence: Trent Tucker Kelvin Trent Tucker (born December 20, 1959) is an American former professional basketball player who played eleven seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA).
A 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m) shooting guard, Tucker attended the University of Minnesota from 1978 to 1982, leading them to a Big Ten Conference championship in his senior year. He was then selected by the New York Knicks with the 6th overall pick of the 1982 NBA draft
Candidate Sentence: The shot counted and the Knicks won. After Bulls' coach Phil Jackson vociferously complained following the game, the NBA immediately established a rule, which states that 0.3 needs to be on the clock in order for a player to get a shot off whether they make it or not. Inside of 0.3 seconds, only a tip-in or a high lob would count.
This rule is also used in 3x3 basketball.
Post-playing career After retiring, Tucker worked as a broadcast analyst for Minnesota Timberwolves basketball games
